G2 runs on the Arduino Due, and can be used with the [gShield](https://github.com/synthetos/grblShield/wiki) to build a high performance 3 axis motion control system.

G2 has a number of advanced features, including:
* Full 6 axis motion control - XYZ linear axes and ABC rotary axes
* Jerk controlled motion for acceleration planning (S curve 3rd order motion planning)
* RESTful interface using JSON
* Complete status and system state displays
