/****************************************************************************************
 * cm_alarm() - enter ALARM state
 *
 * An ALARM sets the ALARM machine state, starts a feedhold to stop motion, stops the
 * spindle, turns off coolant, clears out queued planner moves and serial input,
 * and rejects new action commands (gcode blocks, SET commands, and other actions)
 * until the alarm is cleared.
 *
 * ALARM is typically entered by a soft limit or a limit switch being hit. In the
 * limit switch case the INPUT_ACTION will override the feedhold - i.e. if the
 * input action is "FAST_STOP" or "HALT" that setting will take precedence over
 * the feedhold native to the alarm function.
 *
 * Gcode and machine state is preserved. It may be possible to recover the job from
 * an alarm, but in many cases this is not possible. Since ALARM attempts to preserve
 * Gcode and machine state it does not END the job.
 *
 * ALARM may also be invoked from the command line using {alarm:n} or $alarm
 * ALARM can be manually cleared by entering: {clear:n}, {clr:n}, $clear, or $clr
 * ALARMs will also clear on receipt of an M30 or M2 command if one is received
 * while draining the host command queue.
