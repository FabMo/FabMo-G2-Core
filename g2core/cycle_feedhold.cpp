 **** Feedholds *************************************************************************
 ****************************************************************************************/
/*
 *  Feedholds, queue flushes and end_holds are all related and are performed in this
 *  file and in plan_exec.cpp. Feedholds are implemented as a state machine 
 *  (cmFeedholdState) that runs in these files. 
 *
 *  There are 2 planners: p1 (primary planner) and p2 (secondary planner). A feedhold
 *  received while in p1 stops motion in p1 and transitions to p2, where entry actions
 *  like Z lift, spindle and coolant pause occur. While in p2 (almost) all machine 
 *  operations are available. 
 *
 *  A feedhold received while in p2 (a feedhold within a feedhold - very Inception)
 *  stops motion in p2 and flushes the p2 planner. Control remains in p2.
 *
 *  A feedhold exit request (~) received while in either p1 or p2 will execute the 
 *  feedhold exit actions:
 *    - Resume coolant (if paused)
 *    - Resume spindle (if paused) with spinup delay
 *    - Move back to starting location in XY, then plunge in Z
 *  Motion will resume in p1 after the exit actions complete
 *
 *  A feedhold flush request (%) received while in either p1 or p2 will execute the
 *  exit actions, flush the p1 and p2 queues, then stop motion at the hold point.
 */
/*
 * Feedhold Processing - Performs the following cases (listed in rough sequence order):
 *
 *  (0) - Feedhold request arrives or cm_start_hold() is called
 *
 * Control transfers to plan_exec.cpp feedhold functions:
 *
 *  (1) - Feedhold arrives while we are in the middle executing of a block
 *   (1a) - The block is currently accelerating - wait for the end of acceleration
 *   (1b) - The block is in a head, but has not started execution yet - start deceleration
 *    (1b1) - The deceleration fits into the current block
 *    (1b2) - The deceleration does not fit and needs to continue in the next block
 *   (1c) - The block is in a body - start deceleration
 *    (1c1) - The deceleration fits into the current block
 *    (1c2) - The deceleration does not fit and needs to continue in the next block
 *   (1d) - The block is currently in the tail - wait until the end of the block
 *   (1e) - We have a new block and a new feedhold request that arrived at EXACTLY the same time
 *          (unlikely, but handled as 1b).
 *
 *  (2) - The block has decelerated to some velocity > zero, so needs continuation into next block
 *  (3) - The end of deceleration is detected inline in mp_exec_aline()
 *  (4) - Finished all runtime work, now wait for the motors to stop on HOLD point. When they do:
 *   (4a) - It's a homing or probing feedhold - ditch the remaining buffer & go directly to OFF
 *   (4b) - It's a p2 feedhold - ditch the remaining buffer & signal we want a p2 queue flush
 *   (4c) - It's a normal feedhold - signal we want the p2 entry actions to execute
 *
 * Control transfers back to cycle_feedhold.cpp feedhold functions:
 *
 *  (5) - Run the P2 entry actions and transition to HOLD state when complete
 *  (6) - Remove the hold state / there is queued motion - see cycle_feedhold.cpp
 *  (7) - Remove the hold state / there is no queued motion - see cycle_feedhold.cpp

 * 
 *  request_feedhold:

 *    - If both p1 and p2 are in HOLD, request_feedhold is ignored
 *
 *  request_end_hold:
 *    - If p1 is not in HOLD, request_end_hold is ignored
 *    - If p1 is in HOLD request_end_hold will end p1 hold & resume motion.
 *      Pre-defined exit actions (coolant, spindle, Z move) are completed first
 *      Any executing or pending "in-hold" moves are stopped prior to the exit actions
 *
 *  request_queue_flush:
 *    - If p1 is not in HOLD, request_queue_flush is ignored
 *    - If p1 is in HOLD request_queue_flush will end p1 hold & queue flush (stop motion).
 *      Pre-defined exit actions (coolant, spindle, Z move) are completed first
 *      Any executing or pending "in-hold" moves are stopped prior to the exit actions

 * This one's complicated. See here first:

 * https://github.com/synthetos/g2/wiki/Alarm-Processing
 *
 * We want to use queue flush for a few different use cases, as per the above wiki pages.
 * The % behavior implements Exception Handling cases 1 and 2 - Stop a Single Move and
 * Stop Multiple Moves. This is complicated further by the processing in single USB and
 * dual USB being different. Also, the state handling is located in xio.cpp / readline(),
 * controller.cpp _dispatch_kernel() and cm_request_queue_flush(), below.
 * So it's documented here.
 *
 * Single or Dual USB Channels:
 *  - If a % is received outside of a feed hold or ALARM state, ignore it.
 *      Change the % to a ; comment symbol (xio)
 *
 * Single USB Channel Operation:
 *  - Enter a feedhold (!)
 *  - Receive a queue flush (%) Both dispatch it and store a marker (ACK) in the input
 *      buffer in place of the the % (xio)
 *  - Execute the feedhold to a hold condition (plan_exec)
 *  - Execute the dispatched % to flush queues (canonical_machine)
 *  - Silently reject any commands up to the % in the input queue (controller)
 *  - When ETX is encountered transition to STOP state (controller/canonical_machine)
 *
 * Dual USB Channel Operation:
 *  - Same as above except that we expect the % to arrive on the control channel
 *  - The system will read and dump all commands in the data channel until either a
 *    clear is encountered ({clear:n} or $clear), or an ETX is encountered on either
 *    channel, but it really should be on the data channel to ensure all queued commands
 *    are dumped. It is the host's responsibility to both write the clear (or ETX), and
 *    to ensure that it either arrives on the data channel or that the data channel is
 *    empty before writing it to the control channel.
